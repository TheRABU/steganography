## Solving my steganographies..
1.	Firstly I checked the file type of the given problems in the stegs folder with the command “file filename.extension” so the command was
 “ file super.jpg ”   then used the command and the original filetype was JPG.

2.	Then “ stegseek super.jpg /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt “ 
3.	A new super.jpg.output created…then just simply “ cat super.jpg.output “ to see the flag.. 
4.	flag{steg_ieee_cse} .

  



#### solving two images which makes no sense ..
1.	Run the command “ gmic ciphered.png secret.png -blend xor “ 
2.	And you have a image of a cat..
 


### now the image called cute.png
1.	using the tool binwalk… “  binwalk --dd=".*" cute.png -e  “ and this command a new file generated.
2.	Now inside that new file we can see our flag.  apisc2020{Basic_Steganography} 
 



##### the bird.jpg 
1.	“ file bird.jpg “ it is a jpeg file…
2.	“ steghide extract -sf bird.jpg “ 
3.	Gets a crypto file 
4.	Give execute permission to that file “ chmod +x crypto “
5.	Get flag Flag {%s} .
